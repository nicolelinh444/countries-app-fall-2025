🧠 VERSION 3 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET 
-------------------------------------

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint? 
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type? 
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data type? 
  
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data? 
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page? 

3. WHERE does this happen in the code? 
   What component, page or function? 

4. HOW do we accomplish this? 
   What steps do we need to take? 
   Do we need to...
    - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint? 
    - render anything in JSX? 
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions? 
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks? 
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet — just outline the actions in plain language. 

✨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data. 

------------------------
📊 FORM DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
🔶 STORING FORM DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
  API ENDPOINT: /add-one-user

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): OBJECT
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): {
  "name": "Alice",
  "country_name": "Germany",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "bio": "A little about Alice"
}
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: STRING
  RESPONSE: Success! User has been added.

WHEN: WHEN THE USER CLICKS SUBMIT

WHERE: HANDLE SUBMIT, SAVED COUNTRIES PAGE

HOW: 
Step 1: DECLARE A NEW FUNCTION CALLED storeUserData() WHICH SHOULD SEND A POST REQUEST TO THE API TO THE /add-one-user ENDPOINT
Step 2: CALL THE storeUserData() FUNCTION ON SUBMIT
Add more steps as needed! 

------------------------
🔶 RETRIEVING FORM DATA 
------------------------
WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
  API ENDPOINT: /get-newest-user

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): N/A
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): N/A
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ARRAY OF OBJECTS (1 OBJECT)
  RESPONSE: [
  {
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John Smith",
    "country_name": "Canada",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "bio": "Another bio"
  }
]
  
WHEN: INITIAL PAGE LOAD

WHERE: USE EFFECT ON FORM 

HOW: 
Step 1: MAKE A FUNCTION CALLED getNewestUser() THAT WILL GET THE FORM DATA FROM THE API BY SENDING A GET REQUEST TO THE get-newest-user endpoint
Step 2: SAVE THE FORM DATA IN A STATE VARIABLE USING useState()
Step 3: CALL THE getNewestUser() FUNCTION ON PAGE LOAD IN THE useEffect()
Step 4: CONDITIONALLY RENDER THE USER'S NAME IN THE RETURN STATEMENT (IN JSX) IF THE USER'S NAME EXISTS

------------------------
📊 SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
🔶 STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
  API ENDPOINT: /save-one-country

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): OBJECT
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): {
  "country_name": "Brazil"
}
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: STRING
  RESPONSE: Success! The country is saved.

WHEN: WHEN USER CLICKS SAVE BUTTON ON COUNTRY DETAIL PAGE

WHERE: SAVE ON CLICK FUNCTION 

HOW: 
Step 1: IN getSavedCountries FUNCTION, MAKE A POST REQUEST TO THE API USING THE ENDPOINT /save-one-country
Step 2: WHEN THE USER CLICKS THE SAVE BUTTON, THE COUNTRY WILL BE SAVED TO THE API IF NOT ALREADY
Add more steps as needed! 

------------------------
🔶 RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
  API ENDPOINT: /get-all-saved-countries

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): N/A
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): N/A
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ARRAY OF OBJECTS
  RESPONSE: [
  {
    "country_name": "Japan"
  },
  {
    "country_name": "Germany"
  }
]

WHEN: WHEN PAGE LOADS

WHERE: IN SAVED COUNTRIES FUNCTION

HOW: 
Step 1: DECLARE A getSavedCountries FUNCTION THAT WILL CALL THE API AND GET LIST OF SAVED COUNTRIES
Step 2: USE THE ENDPOINT /get-all-saved-countries WITH A GET REQUEST
Step 3: MAP THROUGH THE LIST OF SAVED COUNTRY TO GET NAME OF EACH COUNTRY
Step 4: FIND EACH COUNTRY IN THE countriesData LIST AND CHECK IF IT MATCHES THE DATA
Step 5: CREATE A USE STATE VARIABLE FOR SAVED COUNTRIES
Step 6: SAVE THE LIST OF ALL SAVED COUNTRIES IN THE USE STATE VARIABLE
Step 7: CREATE A USEEFFECT SO THAT THE getSavedCountries FUNCTION WILL RUN ON PAGE LOAD
Step 8: IN THE RETURN, MAP THROUGH savedCountries AND RENDER A COUNTRY CARD FOR EACH SAVED COUNTRY

------------------------
📊 COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
🔶 STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a country’s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
  API ENDPOINT: /update-one-country-count

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): OBJECT
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): {
  "country_name": "France"
}_
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: OBJECT
  RESPONSE: {
  "count": 3
}
  
WHEN: WHEN PAGE LOADS

WHERE: COUNTRY DETAILS PAGE

HOW: 
Step 1: DECLARE AN updateOneCountryCount FUNCTION
Step 2: WHEN THE PAGE LOADS, SEND A POST REQUEST TO THE API ENDPOINT /update-one-country-count
Step 3: PASS IN OBJECT WITH COUNTRY NAME THAT WE WANT TO UPDATE
Step 4: CALL FUNCTION IN USEEFFECT 
Step 5: SAVE COUNT IN A STATE VARIABLE setPageCount
Step 6: RENDER UPDATED COUNT TO THE PAGE USING STATE VARIABLE

🔶 STRETCH GOAL: UNSAVE BUTTON
------------------------
WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
  API ENDPOINT: /unsave-one-country

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): OBJECT
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): {
  "country_name": "Brazil"
}_
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: STRING
  RESPONSE: Success! The country is unsaved.
  
WHEN: WHEN USER CLICKS UNSAVE BUTTON

WHERE: COUNTRY DETAILS PAGE

HOW: 
Step 1: DECLARE unsaveOnClick FUNCTION
Step 2: SEND POST REQUEST TO API USING ENDPOINT /unsave-one-country
Step 3: SET isSaved TO FALSE WHEN BUTTON IS CLICKED
