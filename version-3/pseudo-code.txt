ðŸ§  VERSION 3 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET 
-------------------------------------

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint? 
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type? 
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data type? 
  
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data? 
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page? 

3. WHERE does this happen in the code? 
   What component, page or function? 

4. HOW do we accomplish this? 
   What steps do we need to take? 
   Do we need to...
    - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint? 
    - render anything in JSX? 
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions? 
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks? 
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language. 

âœ¨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data. 

------------------------
ðŸ“Š FORM DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING FORM DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
  API ENDPOINT: /add-one-user

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): OBJECT
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): {
  "name": "Alice",
  "country_name": "Germany",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "bio": "A little about Alice"
}
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: STRING
  RESPONSE: Success! User has been added.

WHEN: WHEN THE USER CLICKS SUBMIT

WHERE: HANDLE SUBMIT, SAVED COUNTRIES PAGE

HOW: 
Step 1: DECLARE A NEW FUNCTION CALLED storeUserData() WHICH SHOULD SEND A POST REQUEST TO THE API TO THE /add-one-user ENDPOINT
Step 2: CALL THE storeUserData() FUNCTION ON SUBMIT

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ RETRIEVING FORM DATA 
------------------------
WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
  API ENDPOINT: /get-newest-user

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): N/A
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): N/A
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ARRAY OF OBJECTS (1 OBJECT)
  RESPONSE: [
  {
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John Smith",
    "country_name": "Canada",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "bio": "Another bio"
  }
]
  
WHEN: INITIAL PAGE LOAD

WHERE: USE EFFECT ON FORM 

HOW: 
Step 1: MAKE A FUNCTION CALLED getNewestUser() THAT WILL GET THE FORM DATA FROM THE API BY SENDING A GET REQUEST TO THE get-newest-user endpoint
Step 2: SAVE THE FORM DATA IN A STATE VARIABLE USING useState()
Step 3: CALL THE getNewestUser() FUNCTION ON PAGE LOAD IN THE useEffect()
Step 4: CONDITIONALLY RENDER THE USER'S NAME IN THE RETURN STATEMENT (IN JSX) IF THE USER'S NAME EXISTS

------------------------
ðŸ“Š SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
  API ENDPOINT: /save-one-country

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): OBJECT
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): {
  "country_name": "Brazil"
}
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: STRING
  RESPONSE: Success! The country is saved.

WHEN: WHEN USER CLICKS SAVE BUTTON ON COUNTRY DETAIL PAGE

WHERE: SAVE ON CLICK FUNCTION 

HOW: 
Step 1: DECLARE SAVED COUNTRIES VARIABLE
Step 2: CHECK IF THERE ARE COUNTRIES SAVED, IF NOT USE EMPTY ARRAY
Step 3: MAP THROUGH SAVED COUNTRIES AND CHECK IF CURRENT COUNTRY HAS BEEN SAVED
Step 4: IF NOT, POST TO API
Add more steps as needed! 

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
  API ENDPOINT: /get-all-saved-countries

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): N/A
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): N/A
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ARRAY OF OBJECTS
  RESPONSE: [
  {
    "country_name": "Japan"
  },
  {
    "country_name": "Germany"
  }
]

WHEN: WHEN PAGE LOADS

WHERE: IN SAVED COUNTRIES FUNCTION

HOW: 
Step 1: GET LIST OF SAVED COUNTRIES FROM API
Step 2: IF NONE EXISTS, USED EMPTY ARRAY
Step 3: RENDER SAVED COUNTRIES TO PAGE
Add more steps as needed! 

------------------------
ðŸ“Š COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a countryâ€™s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
  API ENDPOINT: /update-one-country-count

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): OBJECT
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): {
  "country_name": "France"
}_
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: OBJECT
  RESPONSE: {
  "count": 3
}
  
WHEN: WHEN PAGE LOADS

WHERE: COUNTRY DETAILS PAGE

HOW: 
Step 1: WHEN THE PAGE LOADS, ADD 1 TO COUNTRY COUNT IN API
Step 2: RENDER UPDATED COUNT TO THE PAGE
